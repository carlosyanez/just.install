# Just Install!
<br>
<br>

The purpose of this package is to provide a simple utility to *just install* R packages, without loading it. This is especially useful when using with packages like **[{box}](https://klmr.me/box/)**, which can be use to only load specify functions rather than a full package.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

There are many tools to load install and load packages, which this tool does not try to replace. This package is comprised of just one function (*justinstall()*), which only does the following:


1. Checks if the package is installed. If it is install, it won't load it nor attempt to reinstall.

1. If the package is not present, it will install it from the specified source. If necessary, dependencies will be installed.


Installation sources include CRAN, Github, Bioconductor and CRAN-like repos (like [r-universe](https://r-universe.dev/)).

## How to use

To determine what to install, this package requires a **tibble** listing names and sources:

```{r}
packages_to_install <- tibble::tribble(~package,       ~source,~url,
                                  "librarian",    "Github","DesiQuintans/librarian",    
                                  "box",          "CRAN","",
                                  "randomForest", "CRAN","",    # for RandomForest
                                  "here",         "CRAN","",
                                  "fs",           "CRAN","",
                                  "aussiempas",    "r-universe","https://carlosyanez.r-universe.dev"
                                  )

```


Then, just pass the tibble as input into the function:

```{r}
just.install::justinstall(packages_to_install)
```


Finally, load the packages of functions using your preferred method.
